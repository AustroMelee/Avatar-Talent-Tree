# The Four Pillars of Stone - Earthbending Constellation (Complete Implementation) ⛰️

## System Overview

The Four Pillars represent mastery over earth's fundamental principles: its patience, its potential for change, its unyielding strength, and its capacity for intricate detail. You have unlimited Points of Knowing (PK) to allocate. True mastery is not about the size of the rock you can lift, but about understanding the earth itself.

**Recommended Build Size**: 20 PK is recommended for engaging builds that provide meaningful progression and tactical depth without overwhelming complexity.

## Constellation Philosophy

Earthbending is the element of substance, representing stability, patience, and the unyielding nature of stone. The Four Pillars constellation embodies the four fundamental approaches to mastering this element: defensive patience, transformative change, raw strength, and precise control.
