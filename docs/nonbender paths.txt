Of course. This is a critical task. A non-bender system must be robust, compelling, and adhere strictly to the established canon to stand as a viable and exciting alternative to the bending arts. The previous draft was a good start, but this revision will rebuild it from the ground up according to your specified rules.

Core Principles for This Revision:

Strictly Canon-Compliant: All abilities are direct extrapolations of skills demonstrated by non-benders in Avatar: The Last Airbender and The Legend of Korra. We are modeling Sokka, Asami, Ty Lee, Mai, June, The Yuyan Archers, Varrick, and the Equalists. No superpowers, only peak human potential.

Specific & Nuanced Minor Nodes: Minor nodes are no longer generic bonuses. They are specific, tactical specializations that alter how an ability functions, offering meaningful choices for character customization.

Elimination of Redundancy: A Keystone ability unlocks a new skill. Its minor nodes provide tangible modifications or advanced applications of that specific skill, never just repeating the core benefit.

Descriptive Richness & Clarity: Every node's description is written to be clear, concise, and evocative, explaining exactly what the character can now do in the world of Avatar.

Here is the fully reworked and re-grounded Human Spirit Constellation.

The Human Spirit - The Non-Bender Constellation üõ†Ô∏è
System Overview

The Human Spirit represents mastery over the domains where bending holds no sway: ingenuity, discipline, strategy, and technology. It is the testament that a keen mind, a perfected body, or a well-crafted tool can be just as formidable as any element. You have unlimited Points of Knowing (PK) to allocate.

Constellation: The Human Spirit
Total Points: Unlimited PK
Theme: Ingenuity, Discipline, Strategy, Innovation

The Four Disciplines

The Mastermind - The Grand Plan
Philosophy: "A bender can move a mountain, but a strategist can tell them which mountain to move. The greatest weapon is a mind that is always three steps ahead."
Focus: Tactics, leadership, deception, psychological warfare.

The Innovator - The Forged Future
Philosophy: "The elements are a gift. Technology is a promise‚Äîa promise that we can build a future better, stronger, and more equal than the past."
Focus: Engineering, invention, vehicle mastery, technological warfare.

The Paragon - The Perfected Form
Philosophy: "A bender commands fire. I command every muscle, every nerve, every breath. My body is not a vessel for power; it is the power."
Focus: Peak human conditioning, acrobatics, stealth, and chi-blocking.

The Arsenal - The Tools of the Trade
Philosophy: "A bender is born with one weapon. I have chosen a thousand. The master warrior is not the one with the best weapon, but the one who knows the perfect tool for any job."
Focus: Unparalleled skill with a variety of weapons, both melee and ranged.

Minor Nodes After Genesis:

Intuitive Engineering (1 PK): You can look at a piece of technology and make a very accurate guess as to its function, power source, and primary components.

Scavenger's Eye (1 PK): You are adept at identifying useful parts and materials from scrap heaps and discarded machinery.

Axiom A3: Quivering Palm Technique (5 PK): A legendary and feared chi-blocking technique. With a single, precise touch, you can set up a resonance in a person's chi pathways that remains dormant until you trigger it with a specific clap or vocal command, causing instant, full-body paralysis.
