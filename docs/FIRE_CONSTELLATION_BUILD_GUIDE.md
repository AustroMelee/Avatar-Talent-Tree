# The Eternal Flame - Firebending Constellation (Canonically Refactored) üî•

## System Overview

The Eternal Flame represents mastery over fire, the element of power. It is a constant battle between passion and discipline, breath and fury. You have unlimited Points of Knowing (PK) to allocate. True mastery comes not just from power, but from understanding the source of that power within yourself.

## Constellation Philosophy

Firebending is the element of power, representing passion, energy, and the drive to overcome all obstacles. The Eternal Flame constellation embodies the four fundamental approaches to mastering this element: destructive fury, disciplined precision, life-giving warmth, and the mastery of lightning.

## Path Overview

1. **Raging Inferno** - Destruction and aggressive firebending
2. **Inner Sun** - Life-giving fire and spiritual warmth
3. **Focused Flame** - Precision control and disciplined technique
4. **Cold Tempest** - Lightning generation and mastery
