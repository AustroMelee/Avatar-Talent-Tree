console.log('✅ PHRASE CONCATENATION LOGIC IMPROVEMENTS');
console.log('- Context-aware punctuation beyond simple commas');
console.log('- Auto-inserted conjunctions: "and," "while," "as," "thereby"');
console.log('- Sophisticated transitional phrases for natural prose flow');

console.log('\n✅ SENTENCE VARIETY ENHANCEMENTS');
console.log('- Standalone sentence structures: "This sacred dish..."');
console.log('- Dependent clause openings: "While temple bells chime..."');
console.log('- Compound sentence patterns: balanced clause combinations');
console.log('- Advanced punctuation: semicolons, sophisticated connectors');

console.log('\n✅ ADJACENCY FILTERING SYSTEM');
console.log('- Phrase type classification prevents clustering');
console.log('- No back-to-back spiritual openings or preparation methods');
console.log('- Automatic reordering when conflicts detected');
console.log('- Enhanced variety through type-aware selection');

console.log('\n✅ GRAMMAR CORRECTION PATTERNS');
console.log('- Fixed "for its lovingly" incomplete sentence patterns');
console.log('- Duplicate word removal: "and and" → "and"');
console.log('- Punctuation cleanup: comma spacing, period handling');
