# Avatar Food Generator - 5 Dish Collection (Web System)
Generated on: 2025-06-20, 12:00:20 a.m.
Generator Source: SAME system as web application

This collection demonstrates dishes generated using the exact same logic
that powers the web application. No duplicate code, no inconsistencies.

‚ö†Ô∏è  NOTE: This is a SAMPLE output showing the expected format.
To generate real dishes using the web system, we need to:

1. Import the built TypeScript modules from the web application
2. Use AirNomadDishGenerator.createMainCourse() - same as web
3. Call generator.createDish() for each dish - same as web
4. Format output for CLI display while preserving all data

üîß TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION NEEDED:

To make this script fully functional:

1. Import the web generator modules:
   import { AirNomadDishGenerator } from '../dist/[built-module-path]';

2. Use the exact same generation calls:
   const generator = AirNomadDishGenerator.createMainCourse();
   const dish = generator.createDish();

3. Format the full dish object for CLI output

This ensures 100% consistency with web generation.
