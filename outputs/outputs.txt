PHASE 1: Output Audit and Defect Mapping
Goal:
Systematically identify awkward, repetitive, or bland outputs via batch testing.

Tasks:

Generate 100+ sample dishes with current grammar/logic.

Log outputs into output_audit.md or .csv (name, description, ingredients, technique, all meta).

Manually (or with LLM help) mark:

Redundant phrasing (“in perfect peace” repeats)

Awkward/incoherent combinations (e.g., conflicting moods, overused adjectives)

Lacks “Avatar” flavor (“Spring Imagination” is pretty, but maybe not loreful enough)

Poor flow or overly list-like sentences

Outcome:
List of defect types, repeated phrases, context mismatches, and “unmagical” outputs.

PHASE 2: Phrasebank and Template Polishing
Goal:
Patch weak links found in Phase 1. Add/replace brute-force content where needed.

Tasks:

Deduplicate and weight phrasebanks to avoid overuse (“in perfect peace” should not cluster at end of every description).

Expand phrasebanks where repetition was found (add 20-40 new entries per hit category).

For each template, add “Avatar-world” variants:

Replace generic “Spring Imagination” with lore-driven (“Bison’s Reverie”, “Monk’s Awakening”).

Tune lead-ins and serving phrases to include location, time, and festival context.

Patch “empty slot” bugs—ensure all templates can gracefully handle missing ingredients or context.

Add a “banlist” system for known awkward combos (e.g., never combine “in perfect peace” and “transcendent experience” in the same output).

PHASE 3: Flow & Syntax Refinement Layer
Goal:
Improve sentence structure, flow, and sense of progression in descriptions and lore.

Tasks:

Phrase concatenation logic:

Join with context-aware punctuation, not just commas.

Auto-insert “and,” “while,” “as,” to make outputs read more like prose than checklists.

Sentence variety:

Vary opening structure; sometimes use “Cherished by…” as a standalone, other times as a clause.

Adjacency filter:

Don’t allow back-to-back phrases of same type (“transcendent experience, transcendent vision”).

Optional: Integrate lightweight grammar correction pass (e.g., via LLM or JS library).

PHASE 4: “Avatar Lore Polish” Pass
Goal:
Crank up cultural, spiritual, and narrative Avatar-ness in all outputs.

Tasks:

Enrich grammar banks with references to:

Real Air Nomad locations (Eastern Air Temple, Western Sanctuary)

Named festivals, figures, and sacred events (e.g., “the Guru’s Festival of Repose”)

Invent lore for each technique (“Whisper-Steamed is traditionally used for…”)

Ingredient and technique synergy:

“If technique is Whisper-Steamed and ingredient is Lemongrass, reference cleansing ceremonies”

Tag ingredient combos with custom lore hooks.

Add context triggers for rare legendary/sacred ingredients (these should get unique story text).

PHASE 5: Sensory & Emotional Impact Layer
Goal:
Ensure every dish evokes a mood—visual, taste, aroma, memory, spiritual result.

Tasks:

Expand sensory adjectives and preparation phrases.

Introduce “emotional resonance” snippets:

(“Invites a quiet sense of belonging”)

(“Reminds the eater of tranquil temple gardens”)

Add a short “memory echo” phrase for ultra-rare outputs (“Said to linger on the soul for lifetimes”).

PHASE 6: Output QA Harness and Feedback Loop
Goal:
Systematically test, rate, and refine. Build continuous improvement.

Tasks:

Output batches of 100, scored (1–10) by human/LLM/peer review for:

Avatar-ness, prose quality, sensory impact, lore flavor, repetition.

Flag <7/10 outputs for template or phrasebank review.

Integrate LLM suggestions for new templates/phrases based on weak outputs.

PHASE 7: Lock and Polish for Demo
Goal:
Prepare a showcase batch of “perfect” Air Nomad dishes.

Tasks:

Cherry-pick best outputs.

Manually polish or add rare “signature” templates (“Guru Pathik’s Ascension Stew”).

Ready all logic for horizontal expansion (Earth, Fire, Water) using the same systems.
