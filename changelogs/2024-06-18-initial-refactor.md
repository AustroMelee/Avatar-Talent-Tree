# Changelog - 2024-06-18: Initial Project Refactor

This initial commit addresses the structural integrity of the "Avatar Food Generator" project. The codebase had significant organizational issues, likely stemming from a copy-paste operation that didn't preserve the directory structure. This refactor establishes a clean, scalable, and logical foundation for future development.

## Key Changes:

### 1. File Structure Reorganization

A proper directory structure was created to enforce separation of concerns:

- `src/core/`: Now houses the main business logic for dish generation.
- `src/utils/`: Contains helper functions and utilities.

### 2. File Relocation and Renaming

- **`dishGenerator.js`**: The file `src/domUtils.js` was identified as the core dish generation logic. It has been correctly renamed to `dishGenerator.js` and moved to `src/core/`.
- **`random.js`**: Moved from `src/` to `src/utils/`.

### 3. Creation of Placeholder Modules

The application logic was referencing several non-existent files. To make the project runnable and resolve import errors, the following placeholder modules were created in `src/core/`:

- `ingredientManager.js`
- `nameGenerator.js`
- `loreGenerator.js`
- `descriptionGenerator.js`

A placeholder for the _actual_ `domUtils.js` was also created in `src/utils/` to handle DOM manipulation. These files export the necessary functions but lack implementation.

### 4. HTML and CSS Path Correction

- **`index.html`**: The stylesheet link was corrected from `styles/main.css` to `styles/style.css` to match the actual file in the `styles` directory.

## Current Project State

The project is now structurally sound and free of import/path errors. However, the core functionality is not yet implemented due to the placeholder files. The application will load without crashing, but the dish generation will not work as intended until the logic in the new modules is built out.

## Next Steps

The immediate priority is to implement the logic within the placeholder files, starting with `src/core/ingredientManager.js` to manage ingredient data and rules.
