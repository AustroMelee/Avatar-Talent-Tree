# Changelog: 2024-06-25 - Final Build & Deployment Fixes

This update marks the successful deployment of the application after resolving a final, persistent set of build errors.

## üõ†Ô∏è Build & Deployment

-   **Final Alias Removal**: Hunted down and eliminated the last remaining path aliases in the codebase (`loreGenerator.js`, `nameGenerator.js`). This resolved the final Rollup errors that were preventing a successful build on Netlify.
-   **Published**: The application is now live and stable. The marathon debugging session is officially complete.
