# Changelog - 2024-06-22: Data Layer Modularity Refactor

This update addresses the growing complexity of the project's data layer. As more ingredients were added, the central `nations.js` file became excessively large and difficult to navigate.

## Key Changes:

### 1. Modularization of Nation Data

-   The monolithic `src/core/data/nations.js` file has been **deleted**.
-   It has been replaced by a set of smaller, more focused modules within the `src/core/data/` directory.
-   Each nation now has its own dedicated file (e.g., `airNomads.js`, `fireNation.js`), which exports that nation's specific data object.

### 2. Barrel File Update

-   The main data entry point, `src/core/data/index.js`, has been updated to export all the new, individual nation modules.
-   This ensures that the rest of the application can still access all nation data from a single, convenient import source without needing to change how it references the data.

## Current Project State

The project's data layer is now significantly more organized, scalable, and maintainable. Adding or editing ingredients for a specific nation is now a much simpler process, as developers only need to open the relevant file. This change reduces the cognitive load of working with the data and minimizes the risk of introducing errors into unrelated data sets.
