# Changelog: Rich Narrative Generation & UI Overhaul

This major update transitions the generator from a simple data-filler to a rich narrative engine, focusing on evocative, sensory, and culturally-aware text. The UI has been completely redesigned to present this new, detailed information in a clear and aesthetically pleasing format.

## üöÄ I. Feature Enhancements

### 1. üß† Expanded Data Model
- **Ingredient Enrichment**: The core ingredient data model has been expanded to include `shortDescription` and `culturalSignificance` fields, allowing for "micro-lore" and deeper context for each component.
- **Nation-Level Lore**: Added `servingTraditions` and `chefTips` arrays to nation data files, providing culturally specific details that can be randomly selected for each dish.
- **Flavor Profiles**: The existing `flavorNotes` system is now fully leveraged to generate sommelier-style tasting notes.

### 2. üé® Advanced Text Generation
- **Template-Based Generators**: Moved from static text strings to a dynamic, template-based system for multiple parts of the dish description.
- **New Generator Modules**:
    - `conceptGenerator.js`: Creates evocative, multi-sentence concepts for each dish.
    - `preparationGenerator.js`: Generates dynamic, step-by-step preparation and ritual descriptions.
    - `flavorNotesGenerator.js`: Synthesizes ingredient flavor notes into a cohesive tasting summary.
- **Orchestration**: `dishGenerator.js` was refactored to orchestrate these new modules, selecting random templates and data points (like chef tips) to create varied and rich output.

### 3. üèóÔ∏è UI & Presentation Overhaul
- **Rich, Sectioned Layout**: The UI now renders the dish output in distinct, clearly labeled sections (Concept, Flavor Notes, Ingredients, Preparation, Lore, etc.) for improved readability.
- **Visual Accents**:
    - Rarity-based styling for ingredients (uncommon, rare, legendary).
    - Descriptive icons for each section header.
- **New Rendering Logic**: Implemented a `displayRichDish` function in `domUtils.js` to handle the new complex layout, replacing the previous, simpler display function.
- **CSS Enhancements**: Added new styles in `style.css` to support the sectioned layout, rarity coloring, and overall aesthetic improvements.

## üõ†Ô∏è II. Technical & Architectural Changes

- **Data Modularity**: Created new data files for templates (`conceptTemplates.js`, `preparationTemplates.js`) to separate presentation logic from core data.
- **Code Refactoring**: Major refactoring across `dishGenerator.js`, `domUtils.js`, and `main.js` to support the new data structure and generation flow.
- **File Organization**: Renamed `lore.js` to `dishLoreTemplates.js` for consistency.

## Known Issues
- **Data File Corruption**: A persistent issue is preventing the `src/core/data/airNomads.js` file from being created or updated correctly. As a temporary workaround, the UI is currently hardcoded to display the static `generateDefaultDish()` result to allow for visual review. The full dynamic generation is blocked until this file I/O issue is resolved.
