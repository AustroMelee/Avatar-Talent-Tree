# Changelog - 2024-06-20: Project Documentation

This update introduces comprehensive documentation throughout the project to improve clarity, maintainability, and ease of future development.

## Key Changes:

### 1. High-Level Documentation

- A new `docs/` directory has been created at the project root to house high-level documentation.
- A new file, `docs/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`, was created to provide a detailed guide to the system's purpose, architecture, file structure, and future potential.

### 2. Module-Level Documentation

To explain the specific roles of different parts of the codebase, `README.md` files have been added to each of the `src/` subdirectories:

- **`src/core/README.md`**: Details the responsibilities of each module involved in the core dish generation logic.
- **`src/core/data/README.md`**: Explains the structure and philosophy of the modularized data files.
- **`src/utils/README.md`**: Describes the purpose of the helper modules (`domUtils.js` and `random.js`).

### 3. Root README

- A main `README.md` file has been added to the project root. This file serves as a general introduction for new developers, providing a brief overview, instructions on how to run the project locally, and links to the more detailed documentation.

## Current Project State

The project is now fully documented at both a high level and at the module level. This makes the codebase significantly more approachable for new contributors and easier to maintain long-term.
