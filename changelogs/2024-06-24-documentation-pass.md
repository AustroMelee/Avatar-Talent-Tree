# Changelog: 2024-06-24 - Code Documentation & Cleanup Pass

This update focuses on improving the quality, accuracy, and maintainability of the codebase through a comprehensive documentation and cleanup pass.

## ðŸ§¹ Major Cleanup & Refactoring

-   **Removed Dead Code**: The `src/core/ingredientManager.js` module was significantly refactored to remove over 200 lines of obsolete, confusing, and unused functions left over from previous architectural approaches. This makes the module dramatically easier to understand and maintain.
-   **Simplified Logic**: The ingredient selection functions were streamlined to use a clearer, more direct approach (`getRandomElement`) instead of complex, hard-to-follow logic.

## ðŸ“š Documentation Improvements

-   **JSDoc Audit**: A full audit of all JSDoc annotations was performed across the core generator files (`dishGenerator.js`, `ingredientManager.js`, etc.).
    -   All function-level comments (`@param`, `@returns`, descriptions) were updated to accurately reflect the current function signatures and behavior.
    -   All `@typedef` import paths were corrected to use relative paths, aligning them with the project's new standard and fixing broken type references.
-   **Inline Commenting**: Added inline comments to `dishGenerator.js` to clarify the step-by-step process of dish creation, making the orchestration logic easier to follow.
-   **Improved Readability**: The overall readability of the core logic has been significantly improved, which will make future feature development faster and less error-prone.
