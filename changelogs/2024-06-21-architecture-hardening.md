# Changelog - 2024-06-21: Architecture and Tooling Hardening

This update focuses on significant improvements to the project's architecture, tooling, and developer experience. These changes make the codebase more robust, maintainable, and easier to contribute to.

## Key Changes:

### 1. Data Validation Script

- A new browser-based validation tool (`scripts/validateData.html`) was created to act as a "linter" for all data modules.
- It checks for required fields on ingredients (e.g., `name`, `type`, `rarity`), validates data types, and reports duplicate ingredient names across all nations.
- This prevents silent data-entry errors and ensures content quality.

### 2. Centralized Constants

- A new module, `src/core/constants.js`, was introduced to eliminate "magic strings."
- All nation names (`NATIONS`) and dish categories (`DISH_CATEGORIES`) are now exported from this file as frozen objects.
- Core logic files (`dishGenerator.js`, etc.) were refactored to import and use these constants, improving readability and maintainability.

### 3. Vite Integration and Path Aliases

- The project now uses **Vite** as its build tool and development server.
- A `vite.config.js` file was added to configure path aliases (`@core/`, `@data/`, `@utils/`, `@src/`).
- All `import` statements and JSDoc `@typedef` paths throughout the project were refactored to use these aliases, removing complex relative paths (`../../`).

### 4. Project Standardization (`.lockfile`, `.prettierrc`, `.editorconfig`)

- A `package-lock.json` file was generated to lock dependency versions, ensuring consistent `npm install` results across different machines.
- **Prettier** was added as a dev dependency, along with a `.prettierrc.json` configuration file to enforce a uniform code style.
- An `.editorconfig` file was created to standardize basic editor settings like indentation and character encoding.
- An `npm run format` script was added to auto-format the entire codebase.

### 5. Developer Context File

- A new `.cursorcontext` file was added to the project root.
- This file serves as a guide for future developers, explaining the project's architecture and providing clear, step-by-step instructions for common tasks like adding new ingredients.

## Current Project State

The project is now in a highly stable and professional state. The build system is modern, the codebase is clean and consistently formatted, and several layers of validation and documentation have been added to guide future development. The critical bug with event listeners was also identified and fixed during this process.
