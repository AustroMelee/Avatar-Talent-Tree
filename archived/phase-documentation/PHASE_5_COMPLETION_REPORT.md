if (rarityLevel === 'sacred' && Math.random() < 0.35)    // 35% chance  
if (rarityLevel === 'rare' && Math.random() < 0.05)     // 5% chance
```

## Advanced Integration Features

### **Dynamic Sensory Intensity Calculation**

The system intelligently determines sensory intensity based on multiple factors:

```typescript
function calculateSensoryIntensity(
  hasLegendaryIngredients: boolean,
  techniqueComplexity: 'simple' | 'moderate' | 'complex' | 'masterful',
  spiritualSignificance: boolean
): 'gentle' | 'vibrant' | 'mystical'
```

**Intensity Mapping:**
- **Mystical**: Legendary ingredients OR spiritual significance
- **Vibrant**: Complex/masterful techniques
- **Gentle**: Standard preparation methods

### **Comprehensive Sensory Profile Generation**

```typescript
interface SensoryProfile {
  visual: string;      // Always included
  aroma: string;       // Always included  
  taste: string;       // Always included
  texture: string;     // Always included
  sound?: string;      // 30% chance for gentle, always for vibrant/mystical
  emotionalResonance?: EmotionalResonance; // Configurable inclusion
  memoryEcho?: string; // Rarity-triggered for ultra-rare experiences
}
```

### **Intelligent Emotional Selection**

To avoid overwhelming descriptions, the system:
1. Selects 1-2 emotional elements from 4 available categories
2. Uses anti-clustering to prevent repetition
3. Filters out previously selected emotions for variety

## Impact Analysis

### **Before Phase 5 (Standard Description)**
```

that engages all the senses. This profound dish connects the spirit 
to wind and sky while also marks a moment of spiritual evolution. 
Said to linger on the soul for lifetimes. Traditionally joyfully 
shared during the Harmonic Convergence Feast celebration."
