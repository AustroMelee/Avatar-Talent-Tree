# PHASE 2: PHRASEBANK AND TEMPLATE POLISHING - COMPLETION REPORT

## Overview
Successfully completed Phase 2 of the Avatar Food Generator improvement plan with comprehensive phrasebank expansion, template variable fixes, and Avatar-world lore integration. This phase addressed core defects identified in Phase 1 audit.

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED TASKS

### 1. Template Variable System Overhaul
