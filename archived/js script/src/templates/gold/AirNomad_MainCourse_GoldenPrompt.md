<!-- The final, high-quality output. -->

🍃 Air Moon Peach Main Course
<!-- Icon adds a nice touch of national identity right away. -->

💡 **Concept**
<!-- This concept sets a clear scene and purpose. It's not just "a dish," it's a dish *for* something (meditation) and has a place in the world (attracts sky bison). -->
A light and invigorating Main Course, designed to clear the mind and quiet the spirit for meditation. Its subtle aromas are said to attract passing sky bison.

- **Flavor Notes**
<!-- The flavor notes are poetic and flow well. They use descriptive phrases instead of single words and create a sense of a journey on the palate. -->
A luscious mouthfeel leads the profile, complemented by an undercurrent of mildly sweet undertones and a hint of a floral aroma.

🌱 **Key Ingredients & Roles**
<!-- The list is sorted by role, which is a clear and logical presentation. The micro-lore for each ingredient adds immense depth and worldbuilding. -->
Lavender Buds (seasoning, herb) — Delicate purple buds used in calming teas and for garnishing desserts.
Whisperwind Petals (garnish, Edible Flower) — Gossamer-thin petals that dissolve on the tongue, leaving a hint of sweetness.
Moon Peach (primary, fruit) — A sweet, velvety fruit that grows under the moonlight in temple gardens.
Sky Sprouts (accent, Vegetable) — Crunchy and cool, a favorite snack for young airbenders during flying lessons.
Sky Bison Yoghurt (base, dairy) — A creamy, tangy staple cherished by young nomads, believed to promote spiritual clarity.

🥣 **Preparation & Ritual**
<!-- The preparation is specific and logical. The description focuses on a key ingredient and includes a ritualistic element, making it feel authentic. -->
<!-- NOTE: The line below is an example of a GRAMMATICAL/LOGIC ERROR to catch. "Yoghurt is crushed" is nonsensical. A better generation would be: "Sky Sprouts are crushed gently..." or "Sky Bison Yoghurt is whisked gently..." -->
Sky Bison Yoghurt is crushed gently, then quickly tossed with Sky Sprouts and served immediately to capture its vibrant essence.


🏮 **Serving Tradition**
<!-- This is a simple but effective tradition that adds a layer of culture. -->
Traditionally enjoyed in silence to fully appreciate the complex flavors.

📜 **Lore**
<!-- The lore connects the dish to a specific place (Southern Air Temple) and practice (meditation), grounding it firmly in the world. -->
The ingredients for this dish are grown in the serene hanging gardens of the Southern Air Temple, tended to by monks as a form of active meditation.

🧑‍🍳 **Chef's Tip**
<!-- The tip is both practical and spiritual, fitting the Air Nomad theme perfectly. -->
