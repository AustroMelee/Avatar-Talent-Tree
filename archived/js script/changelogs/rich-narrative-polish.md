# Changelog: Rich Narrative Polish & Intelligence Pass

This update represents a major leap in the quality and dynamism of the generated content, moving from structured data to a truly narrative experience. This was achieved through a combination of data refinement, logic overhauls, and UI enhancements based on detailed user feedback.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Narrative & Grammatical Logic
- **Preparation & Ritual:** The `preparationGenerator` was completely refactored. It now correctly handles plural ingredients (e.g., "Lavender Buds **are** sliced" vs. "Sky Bison Yoghurt **is** whisked") and intelligently focuses the narrative on the most significant ingredient (the `base` or `primary`), resulting in more logical and varied descriptions.
- **Flavor Notes:** The `flavorNotesGenerator` was overhauled to be more poetic. It now uses more sophisticated sentence structures that seamlessly weave together the descriptive flavor phrases from the data files, eliminating redundancies like "notes of delicate floral notes."

### 2. Context-Aware Generation
- **Rare Ingredient Highlighting:** The system is now fully aware of ingredient rarity.
  - **Flavor Notes:** When a 'rare', 'epic', or 'legendary' ingredient is present, the `flavorNotesGenerator` now uses special templates to specifically call out its unique contribution to the flavor profile.
  - **UI Emphasis:** The ingredient list is now sorted by rarity, placing the most special ingredients at the top. They are also styled with distinct colors and bolding to make them stand out visually.
  - **Tooltips:** Rare, epic, and legendary ingredients now have a tooltip on hover that reveals their `culturalSignificance`, adding a layer of discoverability to the UI.

### 3. Expanded & Polished Data
- **Flavor Notes Data:** A full pass was done on all `flavorNotes` across all data files (`airNomads.js`, `fireNation.js`, etc.). Single-word adjectives were replaced with more descriptive, grammatically-sound phrases (e.g., `"silken"` -> `"a silken texture"`), which was foundational to improving the generator's output.
- **Serving Traditions & Chef's Tips:** The pools of generic options for these sections were significantly expanded with more varied, contextual, and even humorous entries to ensure each generation feels unique.

## Bug Fixes & Refactoring
- A recurring build failure caused by a missing `hasSpecialLore` export in `loreGenerator.js` was identified and fixed. This led to a refactoring of the `.cursorcontext` "pitfalls" section to better highlight this common error type.
- The `dishGenerator` was repeatedly refined to correctly handle fallbacks for lore, tips, and traditions, ensuring that special, ingredient-driven content is always prioritized over nation-specific or generic content.
