# Changelog - 2024-06-20: JSDoc and Type Safety Enforcement

This update focuses on improving the internal quality, robustness, and long-term maintainability of the codebase by implementing a strict type-checking system using JSDoc.

## Key Changes:

### 1. `types.js` Enhancement

The central `src/types.js` file was updated with more specific and comprehensive type definitions, such as `NationKey`, `DishType`, and `Theme`, to create a canonical source for all data structures.

### 2. JSDoc Enforcement

Full JSDoc comment blocks, including parameter and return types referencing `types.js`, were added to every function across all modules in `src/core` and `src/utils`. This ensures that data flowing through the system is strictly typed, improving code clarity and enabling static analysis.

### 3. Type Documentation

A new `src/types.README.md` file was created to provide clear documentation for each of the major custom types (e.g., `DishResult`, `Ingredient`), explaining what they represent and what properties they contain.

## Current Project State

The application's logic is now significantly more robust and self-documenting. This type safety will help catch bugs during development, improve IDE autocompletion, and make the codebase much easier for new contributors to understand.
